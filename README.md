# Bicentenary Heroes

**Bicentenary Heroes** is a decision-making game set in the 19th century, a period essential to the Colombian independence process. In a group or alone, the user plays the role of a libertarian army member in charge of achieving Colombia's elusive quest for freedom.  Each mission inspired by the real independence path pushes players facing challenging decisions related to 4 topics. If one of those components is out of balance, the game progressively will guide the players to an uncertain end.

Along the way, the user can share experiences and bits of advice with famous historical characters related to the indigenous communities, pro-independence foreign collaborators, and Afro-communities, all of which are essential in the independence race.
